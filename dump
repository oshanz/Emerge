Use tcpdump

Open qty 2 terminal/shell windows or just use screen.

In the first window, use tcpdump to capture transmission data from/to your NIC (eth0) to a file:

sudo tcpdump -s 9999 -i eth0 -w myfile.txt

In the second window, fire off your ab command:

ab -n 500 -c 200 http://domain.com/test/index.php

When that's all done, parse the file with strings and grep:

strings myfile2.txt | grep -C 3 "200 OK"

You should be able to monitor all the data segments from there by eyeballing or grep'ing the results.
